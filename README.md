🚀 Build a powerful RAG chatbot from scratch in Amazon Bedrock!

🧠 Create a Knowledge Base to hold your chatbot's information.

☁️ Use Amazon S3 and OpenSearch to manage your chatbot's data.

🛠️ Test and refine your chatbot's performance.

This is made possible when we use a special AI technique called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), which is a way to train an AI chatbot on your personal documents. We'll learn how to do this on Amazon Bedrock, an AWS service that gives you access to AI models to bring into your applications.
